               <p>The objective of my website is to create a guide with recommendations and do's & don'ts for living and navigating the city. It is a culturally rich and has so many hidden gems that can be shared. Also since it is so expensive, I would also have to include a section on sustaibake living and having a great time without spending a lot of money.</p>
